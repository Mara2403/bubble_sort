### What is bubble sort?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort):

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as **sinking sort**, is a **simple sorting algorithm** that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, **swapping** their values if needed. 


In other words, each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right.
